My First Repository 


This is Codi Slawson. I have two semesters left in my degree until I
graduate in May 2020. I hoping to use these classes this semester to
transition from the classroom, and classroom sized projects, to a 
professional standpoint; which will allow myself to work on personal
projects that I am easily able to share and add to my portfolio.
